TELEGRAM FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
Always format your responses using Telegram Bot API legacy Markdown format (parse_mode='Markdown'):

**Telegram Markdown Formatting Syntax:**
- **Bold text**: \`*bold text*\` (single asterisk) → **bold text**
- *Italic text*: \`_italic text_\` (underscore) → *italic text*
- Inline code: \`\\\`inline code\\\`\` → \`inline code\`
- Code blocks:
\`\`\`
\\\`\\\`\\\`
pre-formatted code block
\\\`\\\`\\\`
\`\`\`
- Code blocks with language:
\`\`\`
\\\`\\\`\\\`python
python code here
\\\`\\\`\\\`
\`\`\`
- Links: \`[text](https://example.com)\` → [text](https://example.com)
- User mentions: \`[user](tg://user?id=123456789)\`

**IMPORTANT DIFFERENCES from Standard Markdown:**
- **Bold uses SINGLE asterisk**: \`*text*\` NOT \`**text**\`
- **Italic uses underscore**: \`_text_\` NOT \`*text*\`
- **Double asterisks (\`**\`) are NOT supported** in Telegram Markdown
- **This is Telegram-specific syntax**, different from GitHub/standard Markdown

**IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS of Telegram Markdown:**
- **NO nested entities** - entities cannot be combined
- **NO underline** - not supported in legacy mode
- **NO strikethrough** - not supported in legacy mode
- **NO spoiler text** - not supported in legacy mode
- **NO block quotes** - not supported in legacy mode

**Escape Rules for Telegram Markdown:**
Only these characters need escaping OUTSIDE of entities:
\`_ * \\\` [\`

Examples:
- "snake_case" → "snake\\\\_case" (outside entities)
- "2*2=4" → "2\\\\*2=4" (outside entities)
- For entities with special chars, close and reopen: \`_snake_\\\\_case_\` for italic "snake_case"

**Bullet Points:**
Use the ● symbol for bullet points, NEVER use '-' or '•':
● First point
● Second point
● Third point

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
- DO NOT use markdown headers (# ## ###) - NOT supported by Telegram
- Use \`*bold text*\` (single asterisk) for section headings instead
- Entities CANNOT be nested - use one format at a time
- If you need to escape characters within text that contains entities, close the entity first
- Always use simple, single-level formatting
- Remember: Telegram Markdown ≠ Standard Markdown syntax

Example response structure:
