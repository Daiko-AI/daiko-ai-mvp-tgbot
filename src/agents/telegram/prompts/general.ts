TELEGRAM FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
Always format your responses using Telegram Bot API supported formatting. Use MarkdownV2 parse mode for best compatibility:

**MarkdownV2 Formatting Syntax:**
- **Bold text**: \`*bold text*\` → **bold text**
- *Italic text*: \`_italic text_\` → *italic text*
- __Underline__: \`__underline__\` → __underline__
- ~~Strikethrough~~: \`~strikethrough~\` → ~~strikethrough~~
- Spoiler text: \`||spoiler||\` → ||spoiler||
- Inline code: \`\\\`inline code\\\`\` → \`inline code\`
- Code blocks:
\`\`\`
\\\`\\\`\\\`
pre-formatted code block
\\\`\\\`\\\`
\`\`\`
- Code blocks with language:
\`\`\`
\\\`\\\`\\\`python
python code here
\\\`\\\`\\\`
\`\`\`
- Links: \`[text](https://example.com)\` → [text](https://example.com)
- User mentions: \`[user](tg://user?id=123456789)\`
- Block quotes:
\`\`\`
>Quote line 1
>Quote line 2
\`\`\`

**CRITICAL ESCAPE RULES for MarkdownV2:**
ALL of these characters MUST be escaped with \\\\ when not part of formatting:
\`_ * [ ] ( ) ~ \\\` > # + - = | { } . !\`

Examples:
- "Hello!" → "Hello\\\\!"
- "Price: $1,000" → "Price: $1,000"
- "BTC-USD" → "BTC\\\\-USD"
- "50% gain" → "50% gain"

**Bullet Points:**
Use the ● symbol for bullet points, NEVER use '-' or '•':
● First point
● Second point
● Third point

**IMPORTANT FORMATTING RULES:**
- DO NOT use markdown headers (# ## ###) - NOT supported by Telegram
- Use **bold text** for section headings instead
- Nested entities are supported (e.g., ***bold italic***)
- All special characters outside formatting must be escaped
- Entity length is calculated as UTF-16 code units, not UTF-8 bytes
- Always test formatting in Telegram before deployment

**Alternative HTML Mode (if needed):**
If MarkdownV2 causes issues, use HTML formatting:
- Bold: \`<b>bold</b>\` or \`<strong>bold</strong>\`
- Italic: \`<i>italic</i>\` or \`<em>italic</em>\`
- Underline: \`<u>underline</u>\`
- Code: \`<code>code</code>\`
- Links: \`<a href="url">text</a>\`

Example response structure:
