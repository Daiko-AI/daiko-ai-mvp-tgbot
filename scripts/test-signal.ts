💰 **$0.00002364** | 🎯 **85%** | ⚠️ **Medium**

📊 **Market Snapshot**
• **Price**: $0.00002364 (-8.2% today)
• **Timeframe**: 1-4h re-check recommended
• **Risk Level**: Medium volatility environment
• **Action**: Consider accumulation on dips

🔍 **Why:**
• RSI 22 - extremely oversold conditions favor buyers
• Bollinger %B 15% - approaching oversold territory
• Volume Flow +1.8σ - moderate volume inflow
• VWAP -2.1% - price significantly below average
• Volatility 4.2% - moderate volatility - normal price movement

🎯 **Suggested Action**
Monitor for reversal signals. RSI below 25 often leads to bounce.
Consider dollar-cost averaging if you believe in long-term fundamentals.

⚠️ **Risk Management**
Set stop-loss below recent support levels. High volatility expected.

📋 **DYOR - Always do your own research.**`,
